# meta-msu-de10-nano
Meta Layers to support the EELE 467 and 468 FPGA Course at Montana State University

This repo's purpose is to help adapt the workflow found in the book [Advanced Digital System Design using SoC FPGAs](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-15416-4) by Dr. Snider, to a yocto style workflow when it comes to software development for SoC FPGAs.

Along with that this repo will also be adapting the necassary software found in the [FPGA Open Speech Tools(Frost)](https://github.com/fpga-open-speech-tools/) github organization.

The Ultimate goal being is to have a concise repository to build all necassary kernel drivers and software to run the examples in the book.
